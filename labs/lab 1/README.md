# FIRST LAB

basic java stuff, some things were tricky to figure out such as java.time.LocalDate (Q6) but thanks to a bit of googling and helpfull codetips in vs we struggled through it! 

### things to rem 

<pre>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Q8 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter your first name:");
        String first = input.nextLine();

</pre>
